# 🎨✨ Geometric Shape Calculator Project ✨🎨

This project is dedicated to building an **interactive system** for calculating geometric properties of various shapes!  
Just enter details like **length**, **dimension**, **height**, and more, and instantly get the **perimeter** and the **name of the shape**!  
Our goal: make learning and computing geometry **fun, simple, and accurate** for everyone. 🚀
